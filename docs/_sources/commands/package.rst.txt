Package
==================

The `carme package` helps you install modules, archive, and share your work.  This functionality comes primarily through packages.

Usage: carme package [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Commands:
  create    Create a package from the current project.
  install   Install a package into the project.

Let's get started with carme package install:

`carme package install jupyter-cpu`

This will create a new package, zipping all files and adding those files to a zip file in the /package directory. The entire directory structure can be installed quickly then by others with just the url.

`carme package create`
